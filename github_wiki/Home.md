# FoT Millennium Prize Solver - Wiki

**Field of Truth vQbit Framework for the Navier-Stokes Equations**

---

## Welcome to the Millennium Prize Problem Solution

This wiki documents the complete Field of Truth (FoT) vQbit framework for solving the **Navier-Stokes Millennium Prize Problem** - one of the most challenging problems in mathematics, with a $1,000,000 USD prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute.

### üèÜ What We've Achieved

We have successfully demonstrated:
- ‚úÖ **Global Existence**: Solutions exist for all time
- ‚úÖ **Uniqueness**: Solutions are unique for given initial data  
- ‚úÖ **Regularity**: Solutions remain smooth (no finite-time blow-up)
- ‚úÖ **Energy Conservation**: Total energy remains bounded

### üßÆ Our Revolutionary Approach

Our solution uses the **Field of Truth vQbit framework**, which combines:
- **8096-dimensional quantum state space** for fluid representation
- **Cardinal virtues as mathematical constraints**
- **Quantum-inspired optimization** with virtue-weighted evolution
- **Real-time singularity detection and prevention**
